<p>Emory Healthcare Veterans Program</p>
<p>Postdoctoral Fellowship in Behavioral and Cognitive Psychology</p>
<p>We are currently accepting applications for the 2024 training year for the following positions:</p>
<p>- A one-year clinical fellowship, with the option to renew the appointment for an additional year</p>
<p>- A two-year clinical fellowship - preference will be given to applicants applying for this position</p>
<p>- A two-year dual-focused research and clinical fellowship</p>
<p>Applicants are encouraged to specify in their cover letters whether they wish to be considered for (1) the one-year clinical focus; (2) the two-year clinical focus; and/or (3) the dual clinical/research focus. Applicants may apply to more than one focus but should specify their preferred position.</p>
<p>The Emory Healthcare Veterans Program (EHVP) fellowship provides advanced training to prepare trainees to assume a variety of roles as professional psychologists, with in-depth training in serving the mental health needs of our nation’s veteran population. The EHVP Fellowship is structured with a dual focus on advanced clinical training and clinical research. Fellows obtain outstanding training in the practice of clinical psychology under the direction of Drs. Barbara O. Rothbaum and Sheila A.M. Rauch, with in-depth training in evidence-based treatment for invisible wounds (PTSD, MST, TBI, SUD, and depression, among others) among a diverse veteran population. Fellows practice within an interdisciplinary team that provides holistic care including outpatient and innovative intensive outpatient settings. Trainees contribute to the leading edge of knowledge in evidence-based care. Research interests among EHVP faculty include, but are not limited to: PTSD, anxiety, mental health disparities and access to care, psychotherapy outcomes, military sexual trauma (MST), exposure therapy, substance use disorders, virtual reality-based exposure therapies (VRET), adjunctive pharmacological therapies (MDMA, THC), neurobiological predictors/outcomes of treatment, and early intervention/prevention of PTSD. Participation in research provides opportunities to gain a breadth of practice and collaborate with colleagues across the Emory community and nationwide. The Emory Healthcare Veterans Program Postdoctoral Fellowship has a one- and a two-year clinical fellowship where postdoctoral fellows typically engage in some research in addition to their clinical training and a dual-focused research and clinical fellowship that has training in both clinical research and clinical care.</p>
<p>As a program housed within Emory University and Emory Healthcare, the full and rich resources of this thriving community are available to fellows, including access to events, museums, and scholarly fellowship. The program also actively fosters professional development, with support for licensure and frequent opportunities for specialized training, consultation networks, and community outreach. The stipend is currently $56,484 and will be updated in line with any changes to the NIH postdoctoral fellow stipend levels.</p>
<p>The Atlanta metropolitan area is the largest in the state of Georgia, ninth largest in the United States, and home to a diverse population of more than five million residents. Atlanta is home to numerous museums, art galleries, and cultural landmarks, as well as thriving music, film, and sports scenes. Past EHVP fellows have valued the city’s cosmopolitan atmosphere, vibrant green spaces, and reasonable cost of living.</p>
<p>EHVP seeks to create a work environment and organizational culture that reflect the community and society we serve and a climate that appreciates the unique contribution of diverse employees that facilitate their success. We actively encourage applications from members of all groups traditionally underrepresented in clinical psychology and higher education, including ethnic and racial minorities, veterans, and people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Required: PhD/PsyD in Clinical Psychology</p>
<p>Desired: Experience in clinical research, exposure therapy, treatment of PTSD and associated comorbidities, and/or working with veterans</p>
<p>To apply:</p>
<p>1. Send a cover letter, CV, and three letters of recommendation to Dr. Katie Ragsdale, Associate Director of Training, at <span class="wiki-email">ude.yrome|dsgarak#ude.yrome|dsgarak</span>.</p>
<p>Specify in your cover letter whether you wish to be considered for (1) the one-year clinical focus; (2) the two-year clinical focus; and/or (3) the two-year dual clinical/research focus. You may apply to more than one focus but should specify your preferred position.</p>
<p>2. Once you’ve completed step 1 above, please complete the Emory application. We will provide this link to you following receipt of your e-mail application.</p>
<p>Interviews are conducted and offers are made on a rolling basis, so early application is strongly encouraged.</p>
<p>Please direct any questions to Dr. Ragsdale at <span class="wiki-email">ude.yrome|dsgarak#ude.yrome|dsgarak</span>.</p>
